  cd liquibase
  
  # Create local config
  cp liquibase.properties.example liquibase.properties
  
  # Edit with your credentials (DO NOT COMMIT)
  nano liquibase.properties
  
  # Download JDBC driver
  wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.7.8/postgresql-42.7.8.jar
  ```

- [ ] **Install and configure pre-commit hooks**
  ```bash
  pip install pre-commit
  cd /path/to/liquibase/repo
  pre-commit install
  pre-commit run --all-files  # Test it works
  ```

- [ ] **Verify .gitignore is working**
  ```bash
