# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines security best practices and policies for the Liquibase database migration project.

## üö® Critical Security Issues Identified

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RESOLVED ISSUES

The following critical security issues have been identified and remediated:

1. **Hard-coded Database Credentials** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Issue**: `liquibase.properties` contained plain-text database credentials including passwords and IP addresses
   - **Risk**: High - Exposed credentials could allow unauthorized database access
   - **Resolution**: 
     - Added `liquibase.properties` to `.gitignore`
     - Created `liquibase.properties.example` template
     - Pipeline now generates properties file from environment variables
     - Documented secure credential management practices

2. **Binary Files in Repository** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Issue**: JDBC driver JAR file committed to version control
   - **Risk**: Low-Medium - Increases repository size, potential for outdated/vulnerable drivers
   - **Resolution**: 
     - Added `*.jar` to `.gitignore`
     - Pipeline now downloads JDBC driver from Maven Central
     - Documented manual download for local development

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### 1. Credential Management

#### DO's ‚úÖ
- Store all sensitive credentials in CI/CD environment variables
- Use secure secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Create local `.env` files for development (never commit to git)
- Use `liquibase.properties.example` as template
- Rotate credentials quarterly or after any suspected compromise
- Use different credentials for each environment (dev, staging, production)
- Implement least-privilege access (grant only required permissions)

#### DON'Ts ‚ùå
- Never commit real credentials to version control
- Never share credentials via email, Slack, or other communication channels
- Never use production credentials in non-production environments
- Never hardcode credentials in scripts or configuration files
- Never reuse credentials across multiple systems
- Never store credentials in code comments or documentation

### 2. Database Security

#### Connection Security
```yaml
# Always use encrypted connections
url: jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/db?ssl=true&sslmode=require

# For maximum security
url: jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/db?ssl=true&sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/path/to/ca.crt
```

#### Account Security
- Create dedicated service accounts for Liquibase
- Grant minimum required privileges:
  ```sql
  -- Minimum privileges for Liquibase
  GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO liquibase_user;
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO liquibase_user;
  GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO liquibase_user;
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO liquibase_user;
  ```
- Implement IP whitelisting where possible
- Enable database audit logging
- Monitor failed login attempts

### 3. Pipeline Security

#### Environment Variables
Required environment variables that must be secured:
- `DB_HOST` - Database server hostname/IP
- `DB_PORT` - Database server port
- `DB_NAME` - Database name
- `DB_USER` - Database username
- `DB_PASS` - Database password

In GitLab CI/CD:
1. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí CI/CD ‚Üí Variables
2. Add each variable
3. Check "Protected" (only available on protected branches)
4. Check "Masked" (hide values in logs)
5. Uncheck "Expanded" (prevent variable expansion)

#### Pipeline Best Practices
- Use manual approval gates for production deployments
- Restrict pipeline execution to protected branches
- Enable pipeline audit logging
- Review pipeline logs for sensitive data leaks
- Use specific Docker image versions (avoid `:latest`)

### 4. Access Control

#### GitLab Repository Access
- Implement branch protection rules
- Require code review for all changes
- Enable merge request approvals
- Restrict who can merge to main/production branches
- Enable signed commits for critical branches

#### Database Access Audit
Regularly review:
- Who has database access
- What privileges are granted
- When access was last used
- Any unauthorized access attempts

### 5. Monitoring and Auditing

#### What to Monitor
- Database login attempts (successful and failed)
- Schema changes (tracked by Liquibase)
- Unusual query patterns
- Connection from unexpected IPs
- Pipeline execution logs

#### Audit Checklist
- [ ] Review database access logs weekly
- [ ] Audit user privileges monthly
- [ ] Review pipeline logs after each deployment
- [ ] Scan for exposed credentials in repository history
- [ ] Check for vulnerable dependencies quarterly
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS configurations
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

## üîç Vulnerability Scanning

### Regular Security Scans

1. **Repository Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Scan for secrets in git history
   git log -p | grep -i "password\|secret\|key\|token" | head -20
   
   # Use tools like git-secrets or truffleHog
   git-secrets --scan
   ```

2. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Monitor JDBC driver for CVEs
   - Subscribe to PostgreSQL security announcements
   - Update dependencies regularly

3. **Database Security Scanning**
   - Use database security scanners (e.g., pgaudit)
   - Review database configuration hardening guides
   - Implement regular penetration testing

## üöë Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions** (within 1 hour)
   - Rotate all affected credentials immediately
   - Review database audit logs for unauthorized access
   - Check for data exfiltration
   - Notify security team and stakeholders

2. **Investigation** (within 24 hours)
   - Determine scope of compromise
   - Identify how credentials were exposed
   - Review all systems accessible with compromised credentials
   - Document timeline and actions taken

3. **Remediation** (within 1 week)
   - Implement additional security controls
   - Update security policies
   - Conduct security training
   - Perform post-incident review

### If Unauthorized Database Changes Detected

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop all automated deployments
   - Lock down database access
   - Capture evidence (logs, snapshots)
   - Assess damage

2. **Recovery**
   - Restore from last known good backup if needed
   - Use Liquibase rollback if changes were via Liquibase
   - Verify data integrity
   - Document all recovery steps

## üìã Security Checklist for Deployments

Before each production deployment:

- [ ] All credentials stored securely in environment variables
- [ ] No sensitive data in git repository or logs
- [ ] Pipeline approval gates functioning
- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared and tested
- [ ] Change documented and approved
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of maintenance window

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
3. Email security team immediately: [security@yourcompany.com]
4. Include:
